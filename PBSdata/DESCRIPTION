Description: Data objects to illustrate examples in 'PBStools' and to provide
   shapefiles for 'PBSmapx'. These data objects first appeared in a private
   'DFO' package called 'PBSdata' before they were transferred to 'PBSfishery'.
   The latter became too bulky with a plethora of data and functions, so it was
   dismantled to form various smaller packages called 'PBSdata', 'PBStools',
   and 'PBSmapx'.
