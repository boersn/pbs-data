Description: Beautiful data objects to illustrate examples in 'PBStools' and to
   provide shapefiles for 'PBSmapx'. These flying objects first appeared in a
   private 'UFO' package called 'PBSdata' before they were transported to 'PBSfishery'.
   The latter attracted a plethora of unicorns and popsicles, so it was dismantled
   to form three smaller repositories of magic called 'PBSdata', 'PBStools',
   and 'PBSmapx'.
