Description: These data objects first appeared in a private
   DFO package called PBSdata before they were transferred
   to PBSfishery, publicly available on Google Code. 
   PBSfishery became too bulky with a plethora of
   data and functions, so it was dismantled to form various 
   smaller packages called PBSdata, PBStools, and PBSmapx.
