## PBSdata: Data, boundaries, and key codes for PBS packages ##

**PBSdata** contains data objects used primarily by the R packages **PBStools** for illustrating utility examples and **PBSmapx** for drawing various coastline and boundary shapefiles. The data herein either exist in the public domain or are non-proprietary and open for public use.

A useful set of data (regional boundaries, key codes, example data), a GUI interface to **PBSmapping**, and handy utility functions evolved over time (2007-2012) in one R package called **PBSfishery**. In April 2012, we decided to split this package into three separate libraries -- **PBSdata**, **PBSmapx**, and **PBStools** -- for public distribution (see <a href="https://github.com/pbs-software">pbs-software</a>). The three packages experience different levels of change, with **PBStools** undergoing frequent revision, while **PBSdata** and **PBSmapx** remain unchanged for long periods of time.
