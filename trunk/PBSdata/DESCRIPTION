Description: Data objects to illustrate examples in
  PBStools and to provide shapefiles for PBSmapx.
  These data objects first appeared in a private
  DFO package called PBSdata before they were transferred
  to PBSfishery, publicly available on Google Code. 
  PBSfishery became too bulky with a plethora of
  data and functions, so it was dismantled to form various 
  smaller packages called PBSdata, PBStools, and PBSmapx.
